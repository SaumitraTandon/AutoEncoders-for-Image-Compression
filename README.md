## Introduction

Autoencoders are an unsupervised learning technique where we leverage neural networks for the task of representation learning. This masterclass is designed to help you understand and implement autoencoders for image compression tasks.

## Linear Autoencoder

In this section, we explore the basics of linear autoencoders. We start with the theory behind linear autoencoders and then move on to implementation details. 

## Convolutional Autoencoder

Next, we delve into convolutional autoencoders. This section covers how convolutional layers can be used within autoencoders to handle image data more efficiently, improving compression rates and reconstruction quality.

## Variational Autoencoder

We also cover variational autoencoders (VAEs), a type of generative model that provides a probabilistic manner for describing an observation in latent space. This section includes both the theoretical background and practical implementation steps.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you need to install the necessary Python packages. You can do this using pip.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the notebook, simply open it in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed, and then you can run the cells sequentially to train and evaluate the autoencoders.

```bash
jupyter notebook "Computer Vision Masterclass - Autoencoders for image compression.ipynb"
```

## Examples

The notebook includes several examples demonstrating the use of autoencoders for image compression. These examples cover:

- Training a linear autoencoder
- Training a convolutional autoencoder
- Training a variational autoencoder

Each example includes detailed explanations and code to help you understand how autoencoders work and how they can be applied to image compression tasks.
